Stream two Project: Interactive Frontend Development - Code Institute

This project is about two games SIMON and MatchUp Card Game based on Technologies like JavaScript, Jquery, Bootstrap4 and SVG icons.


# UX

My goal in design was to make interactive frontend using updated technologies like Bootstrap4, SVG icons and 3D animated backgroung images. The power and play buttons on SIMON game are interactive svg functional icons. 
To provide interactive user experience I have used 3D animated images in background which provide great look and feel to player. 


# Technologies

HTML
CSS
Bootstrap4
JavaSCript(ES 2015/16)
Jquery
SVG icons


# Testing
 
The site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, FireFox) and on multiple mobile devices (iPhone 4, 5, 7: Chrome and Safari, iPad, Samsung Galaxy) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. During the testing phase, I realized that background-attachment: fixed was not compatible with iOS browsers. On Chrome and Safari in iOS, the background photos appeared zoomed-in and blurry. To fix this, the background-attachment: scroll property value was added in a media query.The games were tested at every stage till completion.
